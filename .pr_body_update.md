## Summary

Fix MCP client generation to include the custom mutator import in the generated `http-client.ts` when a mutator is configured.

## Background

When generating an MCP client with `override.mutator`, `handlers.ts` imported the mutator correctly, but `http-client.ts` used the mutator (e.g., `mcpInstance`) without importing it, causing a runtime error:

```
Error: mcpInstance is not defined
```

This PR ensures `http-client.ts` imports the mutator in the same way as other generators.

## Changes

- MCP generator (`packages/mcp/src/index.ts`):
  - Inject mutator imports into `http-client.ts` using `generateMutatorImports(...)`.
- Tests:
  - Unit: `packages/mcp/src/http-client-imports.test.ts` to assert import generation.
  - Integration (tests workspace):
    - `tests/configs/mcp.config.ts`: adds `petstoreSingleWithMutator` with `override.mutator`.
    - `tests/mutators/mcp-client.ts`: simple mutator for verification.
    - `tests/assertions/assert-mcp-import.js`: asserts the generated `http-client.ts` includes the import.
- Docs: Added `AGENTS.md` contributor guide (concise monorepo instructions).

## Result

Generated `http-client.ts` now includes the mutator import. Example:

```ts
import { mcpInstance } from '../../../mutators/mcp-client';
```

## How To Verify Locally

1. Build packages:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
2. Generate MCP SDKs and run assertion:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   yarn verify:mcp
   # or step-by-step
   yarn generate:mcp && yarn build && yarn assert:mcp-mutator-import
   ```

## Notes

- Addresses: #1
- Some non-MCP tests can be environment-sensitive locally; CI should validate the full matrix.

## Checklist

- [x] Import added to MCP `http-client.ts`
- [x] Unit test added
- [x] Integration generation + assertion added
- [x] Verified locally that the assertion passes
